# pathfix
cli tool for windows that when ran will take whatever's on your clipboard, replace backslashes with frontslashes. also works the other way round if your clipboard doesn't contain any backslashes.

basically just so you can quickly replace a dumb windows path with one thats joined by frontslahes.

ex:

"C:\wahoo\cool\beans" -> "C:/wahoo/cool/beans"

"C:\\\\wahoo\\\\cool\\\\beans" -> "C:/wahoo/cool/beans"

"C:/wahoo/cool/beans" -> "C:\wahoo\cool\beans"
